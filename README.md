## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-   Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
-   Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
-   **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.

## My Process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS library

### What I learned

-   NextJS can be bloatware for simple websites that require minimal navigation.
-   The current app / navigation structure is simple, but had to create an external wrapper component (JobContainer) to manage dark/light mode logic.
-   TailwindCSS classes can make components hard to read and understand.
